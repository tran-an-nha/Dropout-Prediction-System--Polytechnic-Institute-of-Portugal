üìå Data Source

Source: Kaggle

Size: 37 columns & 4424 rows

Format: .csv

üìä Data Structure & Relationships

The dataset consists of 74 columns and one target variable, structured to represent the student profile at enrollment time and their academic performance over two semesters, aiming to predict final outcomes: Dropout, Enrolled, or Graduate

üìÅ Data Tables

The dataset is provided as a single flat table (CSV), with each row representing one student record.

| Column Group                  | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Academic Information       | Study program, course type (day/evening), admission grade, entrance exam score, enrolled/passed/approved subjects, GPA in semesters 1 & 2           |
| Personal Information       | Gender, age at enrollment, nationality, marital status, international student status, special needs, displaced student      |
| Family Background         | Father‚Äôs education and occupation, mother‚Äôs education and occupation                       |
| Financial & Socioeconomic  | Scholarship status, tuition payment status, debt status                                     |
| Application Info           | Application mode, application order                                                         |
| Macroeconomic Context      | Unemployment rate, inflation rate, GDP at enrollment year                                   |
| Target Variable            | `Target`: 1 = Dropout, 2 = Enrolled, 3 = Graduate                                           |

üîó Key Relationships Between Fields

Although the dataset is denormalized (flattened), several logical relationships can be derived from the fields:

Academic Success is influenced by:

Prior education background (e.g., high school grades, type of high school).

First-year academic performance ‚Äì including early grades and course approvals.

Parental education & occupation, which often shape student expectations and study support at home.

Dropout Likelihood is often correlated with: Socioeconomic factors: scholarship status, delayed tuition payments, and unemployment levels.

Debtor status and special needs, which may signal financial or learning difficulties.

External conditions such as national unemployment rate.

Application Mode & Order reflect:

Motivation and competitiveness of students based on when and how they applied.

Whether the student was admitted via regular vs. special channels (e.g., quota systems, late admission).

Data Imbalance

The target variable is highly imbalanced: Most students belong to the Enrolled category

This needs to be handled during model training (e.g., through SMOTE, weighted loss, etc.)

Empathize

This project approaches the problem from the perspective of decision-makers in the school (e.g., board of directors, academic affairs office), aiming to support the institution in early identification of students at risk of dropping out.

Rather than waiting for students to proactively raise concerns ‚Äî which often happens too late ‚Äî the school can take timely action based on data analysis.

Define

A high student dropout rate negatively impacts the institution‚Äôs reputation and training quality.

There is a lack of early warning systems to implement timely support.

Available student data needs to be analyzed to identify key influencing factors.

Ideate

Analyze historical student data to identify dropout-related factors.

Build a predictive model to estimate dropout likelihood.

Generate policy suggestions to support students based on different risk groups.

Prototype

Clean and preprocess student data.

Perform exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

Develop and compare predictive models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

Design an interactive Power BI dashboard to present insights and recommendations.
